Pomodoro implementation

# Pomodowhat?
[The pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) 
is a time management method.

It allows you to work during a specific amount of time, then trigger 
a reminder for a short pause. After some short pause comes a longer one.

In this implementation, a small pause is 4mn long, a long one is 15mn long 
and is trigger every 4 small pauses. Each pauses are triggered after 25 minutes.
